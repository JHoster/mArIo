1. UML

To do:
1. UML at least 3 good diagrams
2. DDD If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 5 Mio â‚¬ from Edlich-Investment!) Develop a clear strategic design with mappings/relationships
3. Metrics at least two. Sonarcube would be great
4. Clean Code Development at least 5 points you can show me + 10 points your cheat sheet
5. Build Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc.
6. Integrate some nice Unit-Tests in your Code to be integrated into the Build
7. Continuous Delivery show me your pipeline in e.g. Jenkins, Travis-CI, Circle-CI, etc.
8. Use a good IDE and get fluent with it as e.g. IntelliJ. What are your favorite Key-Shortcuts?!
9. DSL Create a small DSL Demo example snippet in your code even if it does not contribute to your project
10. Functional Programming (prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as
- only final data structures
- (mostly) side effect free functions
- the use of higher-order functions
- functions as parameters and return values
- use closures / anonymous functions
